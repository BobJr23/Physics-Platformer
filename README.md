# Physics-Platformer

This is a physics-based platformer game that I am making in Python using pygame and pymunk. The game will consist of two players that can move left and right, and jump. The game is affected by gravity and friction. The game will eventually have moving platforms, danger zones, and other obstacles that the players must work together to navigate to reach the end of each level.
